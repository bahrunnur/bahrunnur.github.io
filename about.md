Hi!

I'm a Bachelor (undergraduate) student at Universitas Gadjah Mada. Majoring Computer Science, with special interest in Artificial Intelligence. I love doing research, and of course I do love programming.

My Interests:


- __My Girlfriend__

- __Machine Learning__. Not just talking about classifiers, it's all about from feature engineering to hyperparameter optimization technique.

- __Artificial Neural Network__. From just fully-connected to the recurrent one.

- __"Big Data"__ things like Data Warehouse, Business Intelligence, etc.

- __Application Development__. Web app, Mobile app, Wearable app, etc.

- The list goes on..
