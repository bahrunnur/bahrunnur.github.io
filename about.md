Hi!

I'm a Bachelor (undergraduate) student in Universitas Gadjah Mada. Majoring Computer Science, with special interest about Artificial Intelligence. I love doing some research, and of course I do love programming.

My Interests:

- My Girlfriend
- Machine Learning. Not just talking about classifiers, it's all about from feature engineering to hyperparameter optimization technique.
- Artificial Neural Network. From just fully-connected to the recurrent one.
- "Big Data" things like Data Warehouse, Business Intelligence, etc.
- Application Development. Web app, Mobile app, Wearable app, etc.
- The list goes on..
