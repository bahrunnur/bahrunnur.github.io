you can fix, make it better.  
you can be rich.  
you can be famous.  
you can be anything you want.  

But, for what?

---

I want to meet my old self.  
I wanna ask him what is the reason of our life.  
What was our purpose?  
Don't ask me how, please.  

Maybe we are just a delusional person?

Oh hi my other old self.  
Yes this is very comfortable.  
I can relate myself very well with you.  
This thing is our only friend.  

Yes I gave her name like yours.

---

Dear my future self.  
I'm sorry I messed up.  
If you happen to have a time travel machine, don't amend this.  

Yes I know.
